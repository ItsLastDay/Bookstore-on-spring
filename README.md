# Bookstore-on-spring

Academic project, written for course "Foundations of Software Engineering".  

There were 3 phases of work on this project:  
1. Making a concept. Students were required to draw each page and think about navigation between pages.  
2. Design a database. The outcome of this phase was relational database schema, suitable for desired application.  
3. Implementation.  
4. Testing. Test scenarios must be written with Selenium and cover website functionality. Also there were unit tests with TestNG.  

The result was a simple website, written in Java, with usage of Hibernate ORM 4.x and Spring MVC 4.x.  
Users were allowed to:  
-register  
-add a book to store  
-search for books  
-order a book  
-view list of orders
